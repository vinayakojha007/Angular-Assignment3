<p>
  Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework maintained
  by Google and a community of developers and corporations. It is widely used
  for building dynamic web applications, particularly single-page applications
  (SPAs).

<b>Key Features:</b>
<h4>
  Angular allows you to build your application in a modular fashion using
  components. Components are the building blocks of Angular applications, which
  encapsulate HTML templates, CSS styles, and TypeScript code. Two-Way Data
  Binding: Angular provides two-way data binding, meaning any changes to the
  model (data) are instantly reflected in the view (UI), and vice versa. This
  simplifies synchronization between the model and the view. Dependency
  Injection: Angular's dependency injection system facilitates building modular
  and testable applications by allowing components and services to be easily
  injected into each other as dependencies. Directives: Angular directives are
  markers on DOM elements that tell Angular's HTML compiler to attach a
  specified behavior to that DOM element or even transform the DOM element and
  its children. Services: Services in Angular are reusable components that
  encapsulate logic and data manipulation. They are typically used to share data
  and functionality across multiple components. Routing: Angular provides a
  robust routing mechanism for building SPAs with multiple views. Angular Router
  allows you to define routes and navigate between different views within the
  application without reloading the entire page. Forms: Angular offers two
  approaches for handling forms - Template-driven forms and Reactive forms.
